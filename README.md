# Practice work I did at ITMO University
## Computational Mathematics
This repository is for lab works I did for "Computational Mathematics" discipline.  
This discipline taught us challenges and solutions of computing complex math functions such as:
- System of linear algrebraic equations ([Solve using Python](/lab1))
- Non-linear system ([Solve using Java](/lab2))
- Integral ([Solve using Python](/lab3))
- Approximation functions ([Solve using Python](/lab4))
- Interpolation problem ([Solve using Python](/lab5))
- Cauchy problem ([Solve using Python](/Lab6))
